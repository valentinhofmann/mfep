# Morphological Family Expansion Prediction (MFEP)

This repository contains the code and data for the paper [Predicting the Growth of Morphological Families
from Social and Linguistic Factors](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.649.pdf). 
The paper introduces the task of **Morphological Family Expansion Prediction (MFEP)** as
predicting the increase in the size of a morphological family.
